## Data Source

What data source did you work with?

I worked with the Github Archive API that contains a complete record of public GitHub events for every hour for Januray 2015 stored as newline-delimited JSON files (json.gz). Each line represents a single event, such as a push to a repository, a pull request, an issue being opened, a repository being starred, or a wiki edit. Key information captured for each event includes the type of event, the user who triggered it, the repository involved, event-specific details in the payload, and the timestamp of when the event occurred. This dataset enables analysis of patterns in GitHub activity, including the frequency of different event types over time, popular repositories, and user engagement.
